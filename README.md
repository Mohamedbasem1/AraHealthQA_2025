### 🏅 Our Achievements

| Track | Task | Rank | Competition Link |
|-------|------|------|------------------|
| **Track 2** | Multiple Choice QA | **🥈 2nd Place** | [Competition 8967](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/8967/) |
| **Track 2** | Open-ended QA | **🥈 2nd Place** | [Competition 8740](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/8740/) |

## 🔬 Problem Statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial potential across healthcare applications, but their effectiveness in the **Arabic medical domain** remains significantly underexplored due to:

- ❌ Lack of high-quality, domain-specific Arabic medical datasets
- ❌ Limited benchmarking efforts for Arabic medical AI
- ❌ Cultural and linguistic nuances in Arabic medical terminology
- ❌ Complex clinical knowledge representation in Arabic

**AraHealthQA 2025** addresses this gap by providing curated datasets and structured evaluation frameworks for Arabic medical question answering.
